1. new dataset for EMG
2. leave-one-domain-out results for EMG
3. cross-dataset experiment for EMG
4. cross-dataset experiment on ContrastSense, fix the error in time-window and run different shots and percentages.
    already fix bug, wait LIMU-BERT to finish.
5. mobile model for EMG, overhead evaluation
6. (maybe) potential results on Xavier
    discussion required.
